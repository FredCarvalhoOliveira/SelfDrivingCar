# SelfDrivingCar

This project is an implementation of a self driving car.

### The Car
The car is built on a frame from a toy RC car, I removed all the controller circuits and left only the DC-Motor that powers the wheels, originally the stearing was built using a DC-Motor which meant that there were only three stearing states possible: fully right, fully left or centered. So I removed the old DC-Motor that controlled the stearing and replaced it with a servo motor that enables gradual stearing.
