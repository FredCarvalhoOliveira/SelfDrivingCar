The car is built on a frame from a toy RC car, I threw away all the controller circuits and left only the DC-Motor that powers the wheels, originally the stearing was built based on a DC-Motor

### Lane Detection

### Feature Extraction

### Building the Dataset

### Training the NeuralNet

### Autonomous Driving
